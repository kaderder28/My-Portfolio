					<div class="topic">Photography</div>
					<p>I love taking photos that capture real moments and genuine emotions. Whether it’s people, places, or simple everyday scenes, I try to keep my shots natural and unforced. I enjoy playing with angles, lighting, and timing to make each picture feel alive. For me, photography is all about telling stories and keeping memories that people can look back on and feel something. It’s my way of showing how I see the world.</p>

					<div class="topic">Filming</div>
					<p>Filming lets me capture stories in motion. I enjoy creating videos that feel natural, simple, and easy to watch. Whether it’s short clips, events, or creative projects, I focus on good timing, clear shots, and smooth transitions. I like experimenting with different angles and movements to make each video more engaging. For me, filming isn’t just about recording—it's about bringing ideas to life and making moments feel real on screen.</p>

					<div class="topic">Editing</div>
					<p>Editing is where I bring everything together. I enjoy turning raw photos and videos into clean, polished, and meaningful visuals. Whether it’s color-correcting, adding effects, or fixing small details, I like making each project look its best. I keep my style simple and natural, but I’m always open to trying new techniques. For me, editing is the part where the story really comes to life.</p>

					<div class="topic">Graphic Design</div>
					<p>As a graphic designer, I enjoy creating visuals that are clean, simple, and easy to understand. I like playing with colors, layouts, and shapes to make designs that look good and match the message they’re trying to send. Whether it’s posters, social media content, or small design projects, I focus on making everything clear and visually appealing. For me, graphic design is a fun way to mix creativity with problem-solving and bring ideas to life.</p>

					<p>I enjoy building simple and clean websites that are easy to use and nice to look at. I like working with HTML, CSS, and other tools to turn ideas into real web pages. Whether it’s a personal site or a small project, I focus on good layout, readable design, and smooth user experience. For me, web development is all about creating something that works well and looks good at the same time.</p>
